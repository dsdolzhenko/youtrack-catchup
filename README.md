# youtrack-catchup

A tool to quickly catch up on things that happened in YouTrack.
It is meant to provide a list of issues that require the user's attention.

## Motivation

YouTrack email notifications, at least in the default configuration, generate a lot of noise and are barely useful.
The notifications tab within YouTrack is better, but it's based on the read/unread status of messages.

What I want instead is a list of actionable items related to issues that tell me what I'm expected to do about them.
